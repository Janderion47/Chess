Things that need to be done are listed in the [Chess] project board under the 'Projects' tab. 
If you are working on one of those things, please move the corresponding note to the 'in_progress' card 
to avoid multiple people working on the same thing.

Once you are happy with the changes you've made to your fork, just open a pull request and ill have a look at it.
